# Redux
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

It's time to learn about Redux. Redux is a library that helps you manage the state of your application.
In the wild, you will often see Redux used and mentioned alongside React, but today we will be using Redux to manage the state of a node server only application.

## Butterfly CI

You will be part of creating a revolutionary new CI service. To quickly get up and running the tasks were split among you and your colleagues:

* Designing and setting up an API - Colleague A took this upon him
* Doing all the hard backend work - The Senior dev loves this kind of thing so he took it
* Keeping track and changing application state - This task fell on you

## Making REST Requests

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a cross-platform, powerful app that allows you to send REST queries to your API, you can use it to test your API. Alternatively you can also use [POSTMan](https://www.getpostman.com/).

## Scripts + Helps

To start your server in production mode:

```
yarn start
```

To start your server in development mode with hot reloading:

```
yarn dev
```

To execute linting:

```
yarn lint
```

To run the mocha tests for your reducers/actions:

```
yarn test:mocha
```

To run a simulated use of your server (basically an integration test):

```
yarn test:simulate
```

To simulate, run mocha tests and lint:

```
yarn test
```

To help you debug you will find a debug configuration that is ready to go. This will simultanously start and debug the server and simulation.

## Projects and Builds

The service is structured into two main components for the first version: Projects and Builds

Projects contain information about where to get the code and how to execute the tests of a software projects as well as some additional meta information. This is what an example Project could look like when represented with JSON:

```js
{
  "id": "hykjdLm", // We use a string generated with shortid, but you are free to use another datatype
  "name": "vscode",
  "url": "git@github.com:Microsoft/vscode.git",
  "buildCommand": "yarn && yarn test",
  "language": "JavaScript"
}
```

Also the service keeps track of builds of projects. Builds take the following shape:

```js
{
  "buildNumber": 65481, // A continuous number incrementing for each build in a project
  "status": "Failed", // One of "Pending" | "Running" | "Success" | "Failed"
  "output": "48 out of 13325 Tests failed."
}
```

## Basic Requirements

You are free to decide the shape of your state and the structure of your files on your own.
The only limitation we impose on you is that you have to use `redux` to manage your state, so you will have to
setup a store and define and use actions and reducers.

You are free to install and use any additional packages to help you. Some are already installed for you. `shortid` generates short unique strings
that can be used as id's for projects, you could also just use numbers, up to you. You will also find `underscore` listed in the dependencies. You recreated many of it's functions back in `LoScore`, so the interface should be familiar!

Your colleagues have left helpful comments all over the code where they think you will have to either access or modify the global state.
Search for `TODO` and you should find all places. Each comment comes with a short description of what should be done with the data there.

* [ ] Add redux
* [ ] Design an appropriate structure to represent your state - do not be afraid to iterate on your approach as you work on other tasks as you will find some designs easier to implement than others.
* [ ] Setup a store, actions and reducers
* [ ] Look at all `TODO` comments and implement the proper operations.
* [ ] For API `TODO` you will have to also send the correct result. The current implementation always returns error 418.
* [ ] Pass the simulation! Run `yarn test:simulate` to execute it.
* [ ] Write tests for your actions & reducers. Please put them into the `src/__tests__` folder.

## Medium Requirements

Your CI is taking off!! You are getting hammered with traffic! Unfortunately your server cannot handle it very well and frequently crashes.
This means that all data from before is gone! Oh no!

* [ ] Persist your state and be able to load it up on server start (How you do this is up to you.)

## Advanced Requirements

Congratulations! Your MVP was a success and companies want to pick up this CI too.
You will have to expand the API and your state to represent the companies needs:

* [ ] Add `users` and `organizations`. Users can register via an Endpoint and can be part of an organization. Organizations can own projects and only users belonging to an organization can see their projects. No need for fancy authentication, it's okay to just include the current user in the request.
      Think about new routes and endpoints that you need and if you have to change your state.

## Nightmare Mode

Oh no, the Senior Dev decided he never wants to come back from his vacation!

* [ ] Implement actual build logic.
  * [ ] Checking out a git project
  * [ ] Running build commands
